 * @title AppStorage
 * @dev This library defines the layout of the application's storage and provides utility functions
 *      for interacting with different aspects of the application's state. This includes:
 *      - Managing initialization status
 *      - Preventing reentrancy attacks
 *      - Asset tracking and management
 *      - Function selector mappings for modularity
 *      - Whitelisting and blacklisting of addresses
 *      
 *      It uses a fixed storage slot defined by `APP_STORAGE_POSITION` to ensure
 *      consistent state management across contract upgrades and modular deployments.
